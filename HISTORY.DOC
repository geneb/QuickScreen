This file documents changes/fixes that have been made since the original
release of Quick Screen version 4.00.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

09-30-1991 Version 4.01:

   "Settings", "Beep On Errors" menu choice can now be disabled.

   Problems with file paths that included periods have been corrected.

   Right arrow on a button field correctly moves to the next field the first
   time it is pressed.

   Buttons now flash whenever they are pressed (mouse or keyboard).

   The file RETRIEVE.FRM was missing from disk1.  If the screen library
   CUSTOMER.QSL was saved, the resulting form library CUSTOMER.QFL would be
   missing the field definitions contained in RETRIEVE.FRM.  This caused the
   DEMOCUST.BAS program to give "Subscript out of range" when the "Retrieve"
   dialog box was invoked.

11-19-98  Version 4.02

   Modified DIALOG.BAS and SCRNDISP.BAS and then also recompiled QSCR.EXE
   to fix a "Divide overflow" error when QSCR.EXE is run on very fast
   computers.  Since your programs also use the routines in these files
   when displaying screens using animated effects, this fixes the same
   problem with your programs when they are run on very fast computers.
